# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

This repository focuses on core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in **C++**.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Classes and Objects**: Fundamental building blocks for creating real-world entities.
- **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data and functions into a single unit (class) to restrict direct access.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding internal details and showing only essential features.
- **Inheritance**: Reusing code by deriving new classes from existing ones.
- **Polymorphism**: Using a single interface to represent different data types, including runtime (overriding) and compile-time (overloading).
- **Function Overloading**: Defining multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.
- **Function Overriding**: Redefining a base class function in a derived class.
- **Operator Overloading**: Redefining operators to work with user-defined data types.
- **Dynamic Binding**: Resolving function calls at runtime using virtual functions.
- **Constructor and Destructor**: Managing object creation and cleanup.
- **Friend Functions and Classes**: Granting special access to private members.
- **Templates**: Writing generic and reusable code for functions and classes.
- **Exception Handling**: Managing runtime errors gracefully.
